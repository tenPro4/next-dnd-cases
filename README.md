# Overview
This project aims to aggregate various drag-and-drop (DND) tools and their use cases, showcasing a diverse range of functionalities and implementations. By providing a centralized resource, it serves as a valuable reference for developers looking to integrate DND features into their applications. The project emphasizes practical examples and best practices, making it easier to understand the capabilities and flexibility of DND tools in different scenarios.

# Tools
So far, there are only two tools used, namely [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) and [dnd-kit](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit)
- react-beautiful-dnd: An excellent open-source library backed by a large and active community. Its developer-friendly design makes it easy for beginners to grasp and implement, allowing for seamless drag-and-drop functionality in React applications.
- dnd-kit: A highly versatile library that empowers developers with extensive customization options, allowing them to override numerous aspects of the drag-and-drop experience. While its flexibility is a significant strength, beginners may find that mastering these features takes some time before they can effectively implement them in their projects.
